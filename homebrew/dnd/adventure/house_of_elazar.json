						"Almost everyone agrees that the Elazar Household at the top of the hill is a creepy place at best. Children dare one another to get close enough to touch the heavy iron knocker on the front door before running away squealing, and even the bravest of the townsfolk only walk past if absolutely necessary. The current occupant is Emmanuel Elazar, a pale gaunt man whose thin features and long sleek hair make him appear much younger than his 50+ years.",
						"He very rarely leaves the house, but it somehow always seems empty anyway. Emmanuel is in fact a vampire, from a long line of vampires, but he is the first who has not fully embraced the blood curse. The house has been in his family for generations, but seldom used in recent years so Emmanuel returned here in the hope that he could find a way to remove his vampirism without his family knowing about it. It is important to note that Emmanuel does not wish to remove the curse out of any particular sentimentality or 'goodness', but rather he finds its downsides to outweigh the boons it bestows. In particular he finds the taste of blood utterly repulsive and longs for real food.",
						"After many decades of searching, Emmanuel believes he has found a way to remove his affliction, but it requires the ritual sacrifice of a pair of identical female pre-pubescent twins. Luckily for him, just such a pair lives in the town a few streets over. They have been missing now for over a week as Emmanuel prepares the rites. Despite being a well-practiced spell caster, there is a lot to do, and his thralls are only really capable of manual tasks.",
						"Unluckily for Emmanuel, the townsfolk have hired a group of travelling adventurers to find the boys, and they have a pretty good idea where they should start looking. Should they make their way through the largely abandoned house and into the lair below, will they ultimately decide to save the boys, or will they deem it a greater victory for the town if the resident vampire removes his dark powers and leaves for good?",

But for as long as any of the locals could remember, he never bothered anyone in town.  So, they just let him and his spooky mansion be.  Live and let live... or so they hoped."

And with that foreboding energy, every tree, every eerie stalk of corn, every twisting root on the ground seems to come alive as the night engulfs the world.  Your ears become sharper and your mind paranoid, every rustle of grass snap of a twig is a predator, even if it is just a rabbit or a field mouse.",
