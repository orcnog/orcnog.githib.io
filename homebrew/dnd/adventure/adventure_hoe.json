						"The House of Elazar by Tom Cartos is a spooky one-shot adventure designed for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. The adventure is designed for 3 to 5 players of 3rd level, but its encounters are mechanically balanced for 4 players. This text is written for the Dungeon Master, and it introduces the small town of Hogsbottom (the starting setting of most of my D&D one-shots), the opening narration to help emmerse your players in the setting, and descriptions of each explorable room in the Manor, as well as encounter blocks which describe and help run individual combat encounters.",

								"Almost everyone agrees that the Elazar Household at the top of the hill is a creepy place at best. Children dare one another to get close enough to touch the heavy iron knocker on the front door before running away squealing, and even the bravest of the townsfolk only walk past if absolutely necessary. The current occupant is Emmanuel Elazar, a pale gaunt man whose thin features and long sleek hair make him appear much younger than his 50+ years.",
								"He very rarely leaves the house, but it somehow always seems empty anyway. Emmanuel is in fact a vampire, from a long line of vampires, but he is the first who has not fully embraced the blood curse. The house has been in his family for generations, but seldom used in recent years so Emmanuel returned here in the hope that he could find a way to remove his vampirism without his family knowing about it. It is important to note that Emmanuel does not wish to remove the curse out of any particular sentimentality or 'goodness', but rather he finds its downsides to outweigh the boons it bestows. In particular he finds the taste of blood utterly repulsive and longs for real food.",
								"After many decades of searching, Emmanuel believes he has found a way to remove his affliction, but it requires the ritual sacrifice of a pair of identical female pre-pubescent twins. Luckily for him, just such a pair lives in the town a few streets over. They have been missing now for over a week as Emmanuel prepares the rites. Despite being a well-practiced spell caster, there is a lot to do, and his thralls are only really capable of manual tasks.",
								"Unluckily for Emmanuel, the townsfolk have hired a group of travelling adventurers to find the boys, and they have a pretty good idea where they should start looking. Should they make their way through the largely abandoned house and into the lair below, will they ultimately decide to save the boys, or will they deem it a greater victory for the town if the resident vampire removes his dark powers and leaves for good?"

At its center is The Swaggering Swine, a lively tavern run by the jovial Hampton J. Porkbelly, where villagers gather to celebrate and unwind. Nearby, Darathra Shendrel, the town's skilled blacksmith, crafts the finest weapons around.",
								"Just beyond the cornfields lies Elazar Manor, home to the mysterious Emmanuel Elazar, a recluse who keeps to himself, leaving the townsfolk content to let him be. Higher up, atop Hogs Hill, stands Hogsbottom Manor, home to the miserly family of Lord Higby Hogbottom IV, the town's namesake.",
